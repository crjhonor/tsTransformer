# tsTransformer

To process my dataset, I cannot find a good transformer models suitable as there are many deep learning models already. So I am trying to create one my own.


# Folders Instructions

- /assa # folder to include tools for dataset reading, preprocessing, time features extractions and etc.\
- /model # folder for the transformer model that I am going to create.\
- /data # folder to put on mydataset and temporarily generated data processing outputs.

My dataset is not necessarily put in the data folder as, in fact, I am using the dataset generated by my other projects.

# My Dataset
### Discriptions
I generate my dataset of four parts:
- Part I: trading data.
- Part II: sentiment analysis of public resourced news.
- Part III: sentiment analysis of social media like weibo.
- part IV: time features generated from the data obtaining date.
