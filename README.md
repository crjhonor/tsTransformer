# tsTransformer

To process my dataset, I cannot find a good transformer models suitable as there are many deep learning models already. So I am trying to create one my own.


# Folders Instructions

- /assa # folder to include tools for dataset reading, preprocessing, time features extractions and etc.\
- /model # folder for the transformer model that I am going to create.\
- /data # folder to put on mydataset and temporarily generated data processing outputs.

My dataset is not necessarily put in the data folder as, in fact, I am using the dataset generated by my other projects.

# My Dataset
### Discriptions
I generate my dataset of four parts:
- Part I: trading data. (including commodity trading data, yields of 10 year treasuries, currencies, etc.)
- Part II: sentiment analysis of public resourced news.
- Part III: sentiment analysis of social media like weibo.
- part IV: time features generated from the data obtaining date.

In the beginning, I've already started to generate log return for trading data. Although the current project is inspired 
by "informer, cookieminions" who actually performed the model into the raw sequence of the trading data, I am thinking
of the potential outcome from log return rather than the raw sequence.

# Failed Attempt
### Training online
I've tried baidu AI and AWS during May 2023, but found it pretty much disappointing. While baidu AI is simple but just
simply not working, AWS was too complicated and required a huge amount of work to do out sourcing not only one man can 
achieve. I am thinking that, perhaps I can only stop at where the books published can go so far as the most effective 
tutorial material enough to make progress for me are all from the books. Ever since the ChatGPT, I found it actually 
become more difficult than before to get free resources from the internet, specially the programming.
