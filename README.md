# tsTransformer

To process my dataset, I cannot find a good transformer models suitable as there are many deep learning models already. So I am trying to create one my own.


# Folders Instructions

/assa # folder to include tools for dataset reading, preprocessing, time features extractions and etc.

/model # folder for the transformer model that I am going to create.

/data # folder to put on mydataset and temporarily generated data processing outputs.

My dataset is not necessarily put in the data folder as, in fact, I am using the dataset generated by my other projects.

# My Dataset
